## Project Overview

This repository contains my submission for the CloudThat Independence Day contest. The project involves creating a single responsive web page with the theme of unity and diversity. The goal of the project is to showcase India's rich diversity by highlighting three aspects: culture, religion, and linguistic diversity. The web page also includes interactive elements that allow users to learn more about each diversity aspect through popup messages.
